Solution: Apply the Open/Closed Principle
    To respect the Open/Closed Principle, we need to use inheritance and abstraction to allow extension without modifying the main class.
    We will introduce a PaymentMethod interface and concrete classes for each payment method. 
    The PaymentProcessor class will handle each payment type without being modified.
