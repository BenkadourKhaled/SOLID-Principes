Problems:

    The Employee class violates the SRP because it has multiple responsibilities:
        1- Calculating the salary.
        2- Managing data persistence.
    If you need to change the way the salary is calculated or how employees are saved, it affects the same class, increasing complexity and the risk of errors.
    The code becomes difficult to test and maintain.
